# Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types.
# They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks.
# With namedtuples, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for accessing members of a tuple.

# The problem is to find the average marks of a student from the given input.
# The input consists of a number of students and their marks.
# The output should be the average marks of the students rounded to two decimal places.
